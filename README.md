Movie reviews is a webapp that indexes and searches a collection of user reviews from the popular site [IMdb](http://www.imdb.com/).

The dataset was pulled from [http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). The original dataset contains 25,000 user reviews. For the indexes included in this repro, 10000 of them were processed and included in the index.
